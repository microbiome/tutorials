### Other community indices: Microbiome maturity index (experimental)

The microbiota maturity index has been adapted from [Subramanian,
S. et
al. (2014)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v510/n7505/abs/nature13421.html)
and [Dogra, S. et
al. (2015)](http://mbio.asm.org/content/6/1/e02419-14.short), where
microbiota maturity index has been shown to differentiate healthy
children. In [Korpela et
al. (2016)](www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160126/ncomms10410/full/ncomms10410.html)
this was calculated as the first principal coordinate from a PCoA
(MDS) using only significantly age-associated genus-level taxa (all
groups included). In this function NMDS is used instead. The maturity
index is also adjusted for age. This artificial example is based on
readily available adult data set whereas the maturity index is
typically calculated from and used for babies/children:

```{r div-example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.path = "figure/"}
library(phyloseq)
data("atlas1006")
pseq <- atlas1006
pseq <- subset_samples(pseq, DNA_extraction_method == "r" & time == 0)
pseq <- transform_phyloseq(pseq, "relative.abundance")
maturity.index <- maturity(pseq)
```
