As it can be seen, we see only OTu IDs and this may not be useful to interpret the data. We need to reprccess this figure to include taxonomic information. We can do this as follows:  

```{r,core-example4, fig.width=14, fig.heigth=18, fig.show='hold', out.width = '200px', warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
library(knitr)
# Core with absolute counts and vertical view:
# and minimum population prevalence (given as percentage)
detections <- 10^seq(log10(1), log10(max(abundances(pseq.2))/10), length = 10)

healthycore <- plot_core(pseq.2, plot.type = "heatmap", 
       		 prevalences = prevalences,
       		 detections = detections,
		 colours = rev(brewer.pal(5, "Spectral")),
		 min.prevalence = .9)
# get the data used for plotting 
df <- healthycore$data 

# get the list of OTUs
list <- df$Taxa 

# check the OTU ids
# print(list) 

# get the taxonomy data
tax <- tax_table(pseq.2)
tax <- as.data.frame(tax)

# add the OTus to last column
tax$OTU <- rownames(tax)

# select taxonomy of only 
# those OTUs that are used in the plot
tax2 <- dplyr::filter(tax, rownames(tax) %in% list) 

# head(tax2)

# We will merege all the column into one except the Doamin as all is bacteria in this case
tax.unit <- tidyr::unite(tax2, Taxa_level,c("Domain", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species", "OTU"), sep = "_;", remove = TRUE)

tax.unit$Taxa_level <- gsub(pattern="[a-z]__",replacement="", tax.unit$Taxa_level)

# add this new information into the plot data df

df$Taxa <- tax.unit$Taxa_level

# you can see now we have the taxonomic information
knitr::kable(head(df))

# replace the data in the plot object
healthycore$data <- df

plot(healthycore + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face="italic")))
```
